星星·沃尔科特

今年看到写月亮和星星最好的是沃尔科特。他把月亮的光形容为sane brightness，让人理智、清醒，引领人的心灵，月亮是智慧的头颅，古老、明媚、柔和而坚定。

 星星整首是这样：

Star

Derek Walcott

If, in the light of things, you fade
real, yet wanly withdrawn
to our determined and appropriate
distance, like the moon left on
all night among the leaves, may
you invisibly delight this house;
O star, doubly compassionate, who came
too soon for twilight, too late
for dawn, may your pale flame
direct the worst in us
through chaos
with the passion of
plain day.

1969

我很喜欢他形容的may your pale flame/direct the worst in us through chaos/with the passion of plain day. 星星的美在于引领，迢遥不灭，福至心灵，像耶稣诞生的那颗。可以联系到另一些诗人写星星，都很好，光芒不坠，熠熠生辉。
